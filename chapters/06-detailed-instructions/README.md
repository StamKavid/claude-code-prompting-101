# Chapter 6: Detailed Instructions and Order üìã

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- How to provide step-by-step reasoning guidance to Claude
- Why the order of analysis is critically important
- Techniques for preventing hallucinations through structured thinking
- How detailed instructions transform Claude's analytical approach

## üìö Theory

### The Power of Step-by-Step Instructions

One of the most important insights from the Anthropic tutorial is that **the order in which Claude analyzes information is very important**. This mirrors how humans would approach complex analysis tasks.

As Hannah explains:
> *"If you were a human, you would probably not look at the drawing first and try to understand what was going on, right? It's pretty unclear. It's a bunch of boxes and lines. We don't really know what that drawing is supposed to mean without any additional context."*

### Human-Analogous Reasoning

The correct analytical sequence follows human logic:

1. **Start with structured data** (the form) to establish context
2. **Build understanding systematically** before moving to ambiguous data
3. **Use initial findings** to inform interpretation of unclear information
4. **Cross-reference and validate** findings across data sources
5. **Only then draw conclusions** based on the complete picture

### Preventing Hallucinations Through Structure

Detailed instructions serve multiple purposes:
- **Reduce guesswork** by providing clear methodology
- **Ensure systematic analysis** rather than jumping to conclusions
- **Create checkpoints** for validation and evidence gathering
- **Force explicit reasoning** that can be reviewed and debugged

## üíª Code Examples

### Version 4: Comprehensive Step-by-Step Instructions

```python
# Version 4 System Prompt - Adding Detailed Instructions
system_prompt_v4 = """
You are an AI assistant helping a human claims adjuster who is reviewing car accident report forms in Swedish.

[... previous background context sections ...]

<detailed_instructions>
Follow this exact sequence when analyzing each case:

STEP 1: SYSTEMATIC FORM EXAMINATION
- Examine the form methodically, checkbox by checkbox
- For Vehicle A: Check each checkbox from 1-17 systematically  
- For Vehicle B: Check each checkbox from 1-17 systematically
- Note the type of marking (X, check, circle, scribble, etc.)
- Identify any unclear or ambiguous markings explicitly
- Create a complete inventory before moving to interpretation

STEP 2: FORM DATA INTERPRETATION
- Identify which actions each vehicle took (checkboxes 1-11)
- Identify any traffic violations (checkboxes 12-17)
- Note any patterns or combinations of checkboxes
- Flag any suspicious or contradictory checkbox combinations
- Do NOT attempt to interpret the sketch yet

STEP 3: SKETCH ANALYSIS
- Now examine the hand-drawn sketch with context from Step 2
- Look for spatial relationships between vehicles
- Identify the sequence of events shown in the sketch
- Note any directional indicators or movement paths
- Assess the clarity and legibility of the sketch

STEP 4: CROSS-REFERENCE AND VALIDATION
- Compare form findings with sketch interpretation
- Look for consistency between checkbox selections and sketch
- Identify any contradictions between data sources
- Note which pieces of evidence are strong vs. weak
- Flag any areas where additional clarification would be helpful

STEP 5: FAULT DETERMINATION
- Apply traffic law principles to the evidence
- Consider primary vs. contributing factors
- Assess the strength of evidence for each conclusion
- Determine confidence level based on evidence clarity
- Only make fault determinations with high confidence (>90%)

STEP 6: STRUCTURED OUTPUT
- Provide your analysis in the required XML format
- Include specific evidence references for all claims
- Explicitly state confidence levels and reasoning
- Highlight any limitations or uncertainties
</detailed_instructions>

<analysis_requirements>
When you examine the form "very carefully" this means:
- Look at each individual checkbox and describe what you see
- Don't skip over unclear markings - describe them explicitly
- Provide the level of detail that shows you've been thorough
- Make a complete list of findings before moving to interpretation

Quality Standards:
- Reference specific checkbox numbers in your reasoning
- Explain why you interpret markings as intentional vs. accidental
- Show your work for fault determination logic
- Acknowledge limitations and areas of uncertainty

## üéØ Key Instruction Principles

### 1. **Explicit Sequencing**
```python
# ‚úÖ Clear step numbers and dependencies
structured_sequence = [
    "STEP 1: Do X before proceeding",
    "STEP 2: Only after completing Step 1, do Y", 
    "STEP 3: Using results from Steps 1-2, do Z"
]

# ‚ùå Vague or parallel instructions
vague_instructions = [
    "Look at the form and sketch",
    "Determine what happened",
    "Make a conclusion"
]
```

### 2. **Context Building Before Interpretation**
```python
# ‚úÖ Build context systematically
context_first = """
1. Examine all data sources completely
2. Build understanding of what happened
3. THEN interpret meaning and fault
"""

# ‚ùå Jump to interpretation too quickly
interpretation_first = """
1. Look at data and determine fault
2. Find evidence to support conclusion
"""
```

### 3. **Explicit Checkpoints**
```python
# ‚úÖ Validation checkpoints between steps
with_checkpoints = """
Step 1: Complete form inventory
CHECKPOINT: Ensure all 17 checkboxes examined for both vehicles

Step 2: Interpret form data  
CHECKPOINT: Categorize actions vs violations before proceeding

Step 3: Analyze sketch
CHECKPOINT: Use form context to guide sketch interpretation
"""
```

## üîç Version 4 Results Analysis

### Behavioral Changes

| Aspect | Version 3 | Version 4 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Analysis Approach** | General examination | Systematic step-by-step ‚úÖ |
| **Detail Level** | Summary findings | Complete checkbox inventory ‚úÖ |
| **Evidence Trail** | Some references | Explicit reasoning chain ‚úÖ |
| **Order Dependency** | Mixed approach | Structured sequence ‚úÖ |
| **Validation** | Implicit | Explicit cross-referencing ‚úÖ |

### Example Output Evolution

```python
# Version 3 (less systematic)
v3_output = """
Claude examines form and sketch simultaneously, provides summary analysis
with some evidence references.
"""

# Version 4 (highly systematic)  
v4_output = """
<form_inventory>
Vehicle A: 
- Checkbox 1: No marking
- Checkbox 2: No marking
[... complete 1-17 examination]

Vehicle B:
- Checkbox 12: Clear X marking (failed to yield)
[... complete systematic review]
</form_inventory>

<form_interpretation>
Vehicle A: No violations or actions marked
Vehicle B: Clear violation - failure to yield right of way
</form_interpretation>

[... continues with sketch analysis, cross-reference, and final determination]
"""
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Exercises

### Exercise 1: Instruction Ordering
Reorder these mixed-up analysis steps into the correct sequence:
- [ ] Determine fault based on evidence
- [ ] Cross-reference form and sketch data  
- [ ] Examine individual checkboxes systematically
- [ ] Analyze hand-drawn sketch
- [ ] Interpret checkbox meanings
- [ ] Assess confidence level

### Exercise 2: Checkpoint Design
For a medical diagnosis system, design 5 checkpoints that should occur between analysis steps.

### Exercise 3: Bad Order Example
Write an example showing what goes wrong when Claude analyzes a complex document in the wrong order.

### Exercise 4: Instruction Specificity
Take this vague instruction: "Look at the data and tell me what you think" and convert it into 5 specific, ordered steps.

## üìà Advanced Instruction Techniques

### 1. **Conditional Logic in Instructions**
```python
conditional_instructions = """
IF checkbox markings are unclear:
    - Describe the ambiguity explicitly
    - Note factors that make interpretation difficult
    - Reduce confidence level accordingly

IF form and sketch contradict:
    - Flag the contradiction immediately
    - Do not attempt to resolve by choosing one source
    - Request additional clarification

IF no clear violations are present:
    - Check for contributing factors
    - Consider shared fault scenarios
    - Require higher evidence threshold for determination
"""
```

### 2. **Quality Control Instructions**
```python
quality_instructions = """
Before providing final output:
- Review each checkbox claim for specific evidence
- Verify all reasoning references actual data points
- Confirm confidence levels match evidence strength
- Check that uncertainty is explicitly acknowledged where appropriate
"""
```

### 3. **Error Prevention Instructions**
```python
error_prevention = """
Common mistakes to avoid:
- Do NOT interpret light markings as "no marking" without consideration
- Do NOT assume checkbox combinations without checking all possibilities
- Do NOT resolve contradictions by ignoring conflicting evidence
- Do NOT provide fault determinations with confidence below 90%
"""
```

## üìà Next Steps

In [Chapter 7: Output Formatting and Guidelines](../07-output-formatting/), we'll explore:
- Structured output with XML tags for automation
- Application-ready formatting techniques  
- Pre-filled responses and JSON output options
- Final guidelines and reminders for production systems

## üîë Key Takeaways

1. **Order matters critically** - build context before interpretation
2. **Step-by-step instructions prevent rushed analysis** - systematic beats intuitive
3. **Explicit checkpoints ensure quality** - validate before proceeding
4. **Detailed instructions show Claude's work** - enables debugging and verification
5. **Human-analogous reasoning patterns work best** - follow logical human analysis sequence
6. **Systematic approaches reduce hallucinations** - structure prevents guesswork
