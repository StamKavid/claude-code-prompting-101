# Assessment Rubrics - Claude Code Prompting 101

This document provides detailed rubrics for assessing prompt engineering skills across all course chapters.

## Overall Assessment Philosophy

Assessment in prompt engineering requires both technical accuracy and practical effectiveness. Our rubrics evaluate:

1. **Technical Knowledge** - Understanding of concepts and frameworks
2. **Practical Application** - Ability to create working prompts
3. **Professional Judgment** - Making appropriate design decisions
4. **Systematic Thinking** - Following structured approaches
5. **Quality Assessment** - Evaluating and improving prompt effectiveness
